# -Climate-Change-Dashboard
As we all know Climate change has impacted many parts of the world and disturbed the Sustainability of Mother Earth so we ( Alison Rebello, Rohit . &amp; me ) thought to make a project on Climate change using Power BI and MS excel to show that it is impacting us in a big way. It is also impacting 17 Sustainable development goals of the United Nations and their quest toward Sustainability.  We the students of Goa Institute of Management (GIM) are very concerned about Sustainability and this is a small step from us in form of the Climate Action Dashboard using Power BI in the direction of Sustainability.  Major Impacts include Global warming, Climate refugees, Soil Degradation, a threat to Food Security, Political Stability, etc.  In the Visualisation:  1) We have made a visualization where there is an animated bar chart showing the highest temperature of countries from 1995 to 2020.  2) Lowest temperature countries are represented with the help of a pie chart.  3) Animated Heat Map which depicts variability of temperature across the world from 1995-2020.  The data set is taken from Kaggle and the link to the dataset and Power BI file along with the visualiztion video: https://lnkd.in/d2RedSkD
